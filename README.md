1. Clone this repository into your `quizzes` directory.
1. Create an `index.html` and a `js102.js` file and link them together.
1. Write a JavaScript function that accepts an array of strings as an argument, and returns a new array that is sorted.
1. Write a JavaScript function that accepts an array of integers, and returns a new array that contains elements from the original array that are larger than 25.
1. In your HTML, create one input field of type `text` and one <button> element.
1. Attach an event handler to the button click with jQuery.
1. When the button is clicked retrieve the value of the input box. You should enter in a comma-delimited list of integers (e.g. 10,3,5,67,22).
1. Convert that string of comma-delimited numbers into an array.
1. Pass that array into the function that finds numbers higher than 25. Remember how to convert strings to numbers?
1. The array that is the result of that, pass it into the function that sorts the array.
1. Loop over the sorted array and create a DOM string that wraps a <div> element around each number (e.g. output += something).
